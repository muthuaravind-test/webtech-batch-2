    <h3 class="h2"> About Us</h3>
    <p class="p1">Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences is an Institution with a social concern. Our mission is to raise scientists and entrepreneurs to find solutions by developing products in the areas of food, water, health care and energy with the best skills to solve the problems of Humanity.3-D Printing / Additive Manufacturing has the potential to redefine the manufacturing process which is already replacing many of the existing and traditional manufacturing techniques. Additive Manufacturing significantly reduces material waste, minimizes production time, limits the inventory of raw material and the number of parts needed for an assembly. Many innovative and lifesaving products have already been manufactured and supplied to hospitals during this Covid-19 crisis. The objective of the mission is to redefine the manufacturing processes in industries, develop sustainable additive technologies and integrate modern tools such as Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to re-engineer the manufacturing process.</p>

<h4>Drone Technology for Agricultural Mission</h2>
<p>
Agriculture being the backbone of Indian economy, it has to be
supported with emerging tools and one such tool is drone
technology. Drones are being used for GIS mapping and other
related works, having a potential to solve several problems in
Agriculture. KITS has made it a mission to develop Drones for
scouting ands and crops, inspecting weeds, monitoring and
management of crops and monitoring and managing the grazing
areas and bealth of livestock.
